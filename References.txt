## Prophet
Prophet is open source software released by Facebook’s Core Data Science team. It is available for download on CRAN and PyPI.

We use Prophet, a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well. 

## Why Prophet?

* **Accurate and fast:**  Prophet is used in many applications across Facebook for producing reliable forecasts for planning and goal setting. Facebook finds it to perform better than any other approach in the majority of cases. It fit models in [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) so that you get forecasts in just a few seconds.

* **Fully automatic:** Get a reasonable forecast on messy data with no manual effort. Prophet is robust to outliers, missing data, and dramatic changes in your time series.

* **Tunable forecasts:** The Prophet procedure includes many possibilities for users to tweak and adjust forecasts. You can use human-interpretable parameters to improve your forecast by adding your domain knowledge

* **Available in R or Python:** Facebook has implemented the Prophet procedure in R and Python. Both of them share the same underlying Stan code for fitting. You can use whatever language you’re comfortable with to get forecasts.
